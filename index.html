        <h2>Why We Need This At Hub</h2>
        <p>The gift cards we sell at the hub are boring; face it some random pattern and a logo is just terrible. That's why I propose we have special designs for the seasons. I've done at least 48 hours of lab time at the hub and I've only seen 1 person buy gift cards. With these designs, the gift cards are more lively making them perfect for gifting. I've seen time and time again students begging friends to buy them stuff at the hub, so giving them a gift card for a special occasion would be perfect. Most teachers at this school also enjoy the coffee made by the hub, so giving them a fun lively gift card would be also perfect for thanking them.</p>
